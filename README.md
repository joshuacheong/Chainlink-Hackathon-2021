Predict Perfect is a protocol to track and record publically available prediction estimates of price and earnings of company stocks. By comparing predictions to financial data oracle results we can definitively track the prediction record on the blockchain. In this way we can rank and compare the quality of analysts who make predictions.

# Obtain Analyst Price Targets and Earnings

There are 2 ways analysts can be tracked on the platform
1) Analysts are tracked directly from external stock recommendation API feeds into Oracle jobs
2) Analysts can set up an account and directly publish predictions into the protocol

## Mechanism for Revealing Predictions

Analysts can directly lock in a prediction where it is built into the protocol to remain hidden until the final day when the prediction due date is complete. It would then be revealed if the prediction was accurate or not. Top ranked analysts would be able to charge fees for their latest predictions, if not their predictions would be revealed late. For general users, the main incentive is to obtain the best trading signals from the predictions.
